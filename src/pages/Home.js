      <h3>Writeup: Tarkov Ammo Storage Application</h3>
      <p>
        Full-stack development is a multi-discipline skill, requiring devs to have an End-to-End understanding of an application. This comprehensive understanding is beneficial, as it can lead to efficient problem solving, and improved application architecture.  Within a team, a dev capable of full-stack development is preferred. For example, even if a full-stack dev is tasked within the front-end, their insights can be effectively communicated with members of the back-end, creating a smoother transition between the groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        When creating applications before this project, my role has always been assigned entirely within the front-end or back-end of an application.  This compartmentalizing of roles allowed for better specialization between team members, but it also prevented me from understanding the appâ€™s overall architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this project I have successfully learned, and integrated the various software disciplines necessary to build a web application as a solo full-stack developer.  I have become more adept with:

      <h3>Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        This application uses Python's FastAPI, in conjunction with MySQL data, to create a fast and intuitive RESTful API framework.
